# xCAT-docker-container-rocky9.4
This xCAT Docker image is built on Rocky Linux 9.4 and is fully supported for single-node xCAT management deployments. **With additional configuration, this image also supports a full xCAT High-Availability (HA) setup using: Docker Swarm, PCS (Pacemaker/Corosync) &amp; DRBD**

# Prerequisite: Install Rocky Linux 9.4 Base Image

Before building the xCAT container image, you must install the Rocky Linux 9.4 base image into your environment.

🏁 **Step 1: Install Rocky Linux 9.4 Base Image**

Use the GitHub repository to download and install the Rocky Linux 9.4 base image.

**Follow this GitHub link to install the Rocky Linux 9.4 base image**
***This step is mandatory before building the xCAT container image.***

```


📌 **Why this is required?**

The xCAT container build is based on the Rocky Linux 9.4 minimal root filesystem.
Without installing this base image, the subsequent build steps will fail.

✔️ **After installing the base image**

Once the Rocky Linux 9.4 base image is available in your environment,
you may proceed with building the xCAT container image as described in the next steps of this documentation.

🏁 **Step 2:  Build xCAT docker container image based on rocky9.4**

**Copy xcat docker container image code in to your env.**

```bash
# git clone the code in your environment
git clone https://github.com/OpenHPC-AI/xCAT-docker-container-rocky9.4.git
```
**Build xCAT Contanier Image**

```bash
cd xCAT-docker-container-rocky9.4
docker build --network host  -t xcat_rocky9.4:2.17.0 .
```
